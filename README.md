# KickstarterSuccessPredication
This repository contains the code with solution for capstone project done on success predication of Kickstarter Project. This is a part of Springboard DS career track course.

Executive Summary
==================
Crowdfunding has given the opportunity to various now well know products like pebble watch, Oculus or innovative project like Baubax. As of April-2018 Kickstarter (crowdfunding platform) has raised three billion (3,647,430,067) US dollars from fourteen million people (14,547,043) for three hundred thousand projects using crowdfunding. 
But does all three hundred thousand projects were worth investing?
Do all fourteen million people have the expected rewards on investment? Were all three billion dollars given to projects worth?

In the investment world, it is obvious that there is no simple answer to above questions. But there is an opportunity to provide all clients and audience involved an assistance to take better decision driven by the power of data.   

The problem in this project to be addressed is that <u>**“Is it possible to estimate the probability of success for the recently launched or still running project?”**</u>
